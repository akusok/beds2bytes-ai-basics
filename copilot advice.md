akusok: I am giving a short self-study course on AI in healthcare. Here is the plan for the first video lecture on the basics of AI. I want to record it as a short but interesting to watch video, with maybe some slides and my talking head in the corner. But I never made any videos, and unsure how to start. How do professional Youtubers turn ideas and materials in great educational videos? Please give actionable advices suitable for a novice

GitHub Copilot: Below is a practical, minimal, repeatable workflow used by good educational YouTubers—adapted for a first-timer creating a short AI-in-healthcare basics video.

1. Define the video (10 minutes max)
   - Audience: healthcare professionals with curiosity, mixed technical comfort.
   - Goal: After watching, they can explain (a) what modern AI (LLMs) do, (b) context/attention basics, (c) limits: memory, guardrails, privacy.
   - Single sentence promise (say it early): In 10 minutes you’ll understand what happens when you send a message to an AI tool and what its key limits are.

2. Shape a narrative arc (simple 5-beat flow)
   - Hook (0:00–0:30): A relatable scenario (doctor tries an AI tool—why it’s impressive yet forgetful).
   - Problem (0:30–1:30): Why text was hard vs numbers.
   - Core mechanism (1:30–5:00): Tokens → attention → context window.
   - Limits & consequences (5:00–7:30): Forgetting, hallucination, privacy, guardrails.
   - Practical takeaway (7:30–9:30): How to “work with it” (context engineering, RAG, tools, cautious use).
   - Close (9:30–10:00): Tease next module: lifecycle, privacy deep dive.

3. Write a “performance script” (NOT an essay)
   - Use two columns: Spoken | Visual cue.
   - Mark emphasis with CAPS or bold.
   - Script intro + transitions verbatim; for explanatory middle use bullet prompts to sound natural.
   - Time yourself reading; trim ruthlessly to stay under target.

4. Slide design (keep motion minimal)
   - Rule: 1 concept per slide; avoid paragraphs (your voice does the explaining).
   - Use recurring visual metaphors: 
     * Numbers → table of iris features
     * Tokens → color-coded word chunks
     * Attention → lines connecting words
     * Context window → box that overflows and truncates
     * RAG vs full dump → funnel vs brick wall
   - Maximum styles: Title, body, accent color. No animations beyond simple appear.
   - Put slide number + module tag (e.g., 1/12 Intro to AI) for orientation.

5. Engagement tactics
   - Question every ~90 seconds: “So why can’t it just remember?” Pause half-second.
   - Pattern interrupt: After 3 static slides, switch to head-only, then back.
   - Show a playful wrong answer from an AI (real or mock) to illustrate guardrails need.

6. Voice & delivery
   - Record standing if possible (better energy).
   - Pace: Aim 150–160 wpm. Leave micro-pauses after key terms (attention… context window… guardrails).
   - Smile slightly—changes vocal tone.
   - Do 1 warm-up take reading the conclusion first (reduces stiffness).

7. Recording setup (starter)
   - Audio first: Use any USB mic (or even iPhone as mic via app). Quiet room, soft furnishings, mic at mouth height, 10–15 cm distance, record 10 seconds of room tone.
   - Camera: 1080p is fine. Stable light: window at 45°. Avoid backlight.
   - Screen recording: Slides in 16:9, dark or light theme consistent.

8. Capture workflow
   - Step 1: Record A-roll (your face) in one or two long takes—don’t chase perfection.
   - Step 2: Record clean slide screen capture without narration.
   - Step 3: Optional: B-roll (cursor highlighting, simple diagram drawing).
   - Step 4: Pick best A-roll segments (rough cut) BEFORE adding slides.

9. Editing (keep simple)
   - Tools: iMovie, CapCut, ScreenFlow, or Descript (easy text-based edits).
   - Pass 1 (Structure): Cut mistakes, tighten silences >1s, keep natural breaths.
   - Pass 2 (Visuals): Add slides timed to concept starts. Light zoom on face every 30–40s to reset attention.
   - Pass 3 (Clarity): On-screen labels for new terms (Attention, Context Window, RAG).
   - Pass 4 (Polish): Add -18 LUFS loudness normalization; light noise reduction only if needed.
   - Export 1080p, 25 or 30 fps, ~10–15 Mbps bitrate.

10. Accessibility & trust
   - Add burned or platform captions (auto then correct key terms).
   - Define acronyms once (RAG = retrieval-augmented generation).
   - Add brief disclaimer: Educational, not clinical guidance.
   - Use neutral tone; avoid hype words like “magical”.

11. Feedback loop
   - Before publishing: Show draft to 2 target viewers; ask only:
     * What was unclear?
     * Where did attention dip?
     * One thing you remember?
   - Fix ONLY the common issues.

12. Reusable assets
   - Keep a slide master; keep your “term labels” file.
   - Save script as future transcript base.
   - Create a thumbnail concept: Split “How AI thinks” vs “Why it forgets”.

13. Avoid common beginner mistakes
   - Reading slides verbatim.
   - Over-animating.
   - Mixing inconsistent audio levels (fix with compressor).
   - Chasing perfection (ship v1; improve next).

14. Simple starter gear (optional upgrades later)
   - USB mic (ATR2100 / Fifine) or phone + lav mic.
   - Basic clamp light + diffusion (white cloth).
   - Cheap tripod or stack of books.

15. Starter script opening (example)
   - Hook: “You ask an AI a question—and it answers instantly. But five minutes later it forgets what you told it. Is it smart—or just really fast at pattern matching?”
   - Promise: “In under 10 minutes you’ll know what happens inside when you send a message, and why its ‘memory’ isn’t what you think.”
   - Transition: “Let’s start with why language was harder than numbers.”

16. Time allocation (target 9–10 min)
   - Hook + promise: 0:45
   - Numbers vs words problem: 1:15
   - Attention mechanism: 2:30
   - Context + forgetting: 2:00
   - RAG, tools, guardrails: 2:00
   - Recap + next tease: 0:30

17. Recap pattern (end slide)
   - AI ≠ thinking; it patterns on tokens.
   - Attention = finds relevant prior words.
   - Context window = short-term buffer that expires.
   - Memory hacks: documents, RAG, summaries.
   - Guardrails = safety + appropriateness layer.

Action: Draft your hook + promise + recap now, then outline slides to match the segment timings before writing the middle detail sentences.
